# Tom's NixOS Configuration

A set of configuration files for various NixOS machines.
Currently very basic and not modular, but it's a living repo.

## Hosts
 - `mojave` - My go-to development Lenovo Thinkpad X390. A pretty decent workhorse.
 - `edinburgh` - My mail server using [Simple Nixos Mailserver](https://gitlab.com/nixos-simple-mailserver/nixos-simple-mailserver)
 to deploy components.
